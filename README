Requires docker-compose >=1.8.0 ? (whatever supports compose file format v2)

This site is a wordpress, backed by a mysql DB.
Both are provided by pre-built images on dockerhub.
Wordpress stores both its data (posts / pages) and metadata (theme info etc) in its db, so no customisation of the wordpress code nor any additional files are required in the wp container.
The only thing that needs to persist these containers is the mysql data in ./db

MySQL passwords are in the docker compose file (mysql runs in an isolated docker network so that's fine, barring a Confused Deputy Problem)
Wordpress admin account (salts in the db): admin/<redacted>
